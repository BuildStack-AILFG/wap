 * Public plan catalogue — the fallback the marketing site shows if the live price list (`GET /api/public/plans`, see livePlans.ts) can't be
 * reached. Keep in step with backend/app/services/plan_catalog.py; the platform admin edits the live values in the admin console.
 * Prices are rupees per month, before 18% GST, for each billing period.
 *
 * Commercial model: the free trial is the whole product with tiny outbound-messaging limits and a few advanced features locked. Both paid
 * plans unlock every feature and differ only in volume, so choosing a plan is a question of "how much", never "which features".
